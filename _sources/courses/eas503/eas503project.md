# Loan Application Project

This project was an end-to-end machine learning project. It started by taking data from a source and inserting it into a database. The database was then normalized. Everything was then joined together to form the dataframe tha would be used for the machine learning models. Seven experiments were conducted and logged in MLFlow. The best model used was chosen and used in a Streamlit app to predict loan approval based on options put in by the user.
