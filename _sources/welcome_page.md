## Projects

### **Hospital Readmission Classification**
- Used logistic regression to classify a patient as being readmitted to a hospital based on several different factors.
- Conducted EDA and data preprocessing using R.

### **Loan Application Classification**
- Built machine learning models using logistic regression, ridge classification, random forest, and XGBoost classification to classify a loan application as accepted or denied.
- Ran several experiments to see if the models could be improved.
- Loaded the initial data into a databse and normalized it.

### **NHL Expected Goals Model**
- Built several machine learning models using data scraped from the National Hockey League's website.
- Cleaned and formatted data scraped using NHL API package in python.
